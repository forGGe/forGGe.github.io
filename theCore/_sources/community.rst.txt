Community and developer guidelines
==================================

To make referencing easier, rules and guidelines (if present) are numbered inside section.

Roadmap
-------

.. note:: This section is under construction.

.. _theCore_Branching:

Branching and release model
---------------------------

There are two main branches - ``develop`` and ``master``.
Both branches are protected against force-pushing unless it is really-really
required (almost never happen).

As names state, all the development (normally) happens in ``develop`` branch,
while ``master`` contains stable versions. ``master`` branch is tagged according
to `the semantic versioning approach`_.

Full explanation of branching model, accepted in theCore you can find in `nvie git article`_.

Code style
----------

.. highlight:: cpp

.. note:: The source formatting script called ``srcformat.sh`` in ``scripts`` directory,
          through it is still under development.

Whitespaces and indentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Do not use tabs. Only spaces are allowed.
#. Set indent to 4 spaces per indent.
#. Indent ``public``, ``private``, ``protected`` with the same indent as
   a ``class`` block.
#. Indent ``class`` block with the same indent as a namespace:

   ::

     // OK
     namespace foo
     {

     class entity
     {
     public:
         /* */
     private:
         /* */
     protected:
         /* */
     };

     } // namespace foo

#. Indent switch blocks so that the ``case X:`` statements are indented in the switch block:

   ::

     // OK
     switch (foo) {
         case 1:
             a += 1;
             break;

         case 2: {
             a += 2;
             break;
         }
     }

#. Do not indent labels.
#. Do not indent preprocessor block.
#. Insert space around operators.
#. Insert space padding between ``if``, ``for``, ``while`` and the following bracket.
#. **Do not leave trailing whitespaces.**

Bracket placement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Use `One True Bracket Style`_.
#. Place brackets in namespaces, classes, extern-"C" and functions on the next line, e.g:

   ::

     // Wrong
     namespace foo {

     }

     // OK
     namespace bar
     {

     }

#. Add brackets to unbracketed one line conditional statements (e.g. ``if``, ``for``, ``while``...).
#. Close whitespace in the angle brackets of template definitions:

   ::

     foo<int, bar<int>> obj;

Code length
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Prefer 80 character code line length. 100 characters is a maximum allowed line length.
#. Prefer to keep functions and methods with not more than 100 lines of code.

Naming
~~~~~~

#. Use `snake_case`_ for identifer names.
#. Use ``m_`` prefix when naming private and protected class members.
#. Use CamelCase style only for template parameters:

   ::

     template<typename CrazyAllocator>
     class my_strange_container;

Comments
~~~~~~~~

#. **Do not leave commented code.**
#. Prefer not keeping ``TODO`` in code without corresponding issue.
   Place issue number next to the ``TODO`` with a little explanation why it is there:

   ::

     // TODO #123: replace foo() with something that exposes smaller IRQ latency.
     foo();

#. Use doxygen for commenting the function prototypes and class methods.
#. Use C++ comment lines for doxygen commenting:

   ::

     //! This function does something.
     //! \details Also it calls 911.
     void foo();

#. Do not use ``\brief`` doxygen directive. Brief tag is set automatically for first comment line.

Commit and PR style
-------------------

.. highlight:: none

#. Try to follow common `git guidelines`_.
#. **Do not keep commits named just** ``FIX`` **,** ``Review`` **,** ``tmp`` **, etc.**
#. Prefer placing issue number at the start of the summary line, prefixed with ``>#``:

   ::

     >#911 Implement calling police officer

#. **Do not** include issue number in the pull request name.
#. Use ``[WIP]`` (Work In Progress) prefix for PRs that are still in progress or review
   and should not be merged right away.
