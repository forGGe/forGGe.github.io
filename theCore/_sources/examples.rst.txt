.. _theCore_Examples:

Examples
========

theCore examples are organized in a form of separate projects that can be
extracted and used as a base for custom application.

Examples are of two types. First is standalone example, placed in
the separate repository for convenience. For such, in each section you will
find a reference to the project location. Second type of examples are in-source
examples, placed under ``examples`` directory within theCore source tree.

Initial setup
-------------

Before any example can be built, an appropriate development environment must
be configured either manually by installing packages like toolchains or
by using Nix.

Using Nix is recommended. The :ref:`theCore_GettingStarted` section contains
the explanation about how to install and run Nix.

To manually install required software without Nix (not recommended),
refer to :ref:`theCore_NoNixInstall` section.
There you will find some insights about getting hand-made development environment.

STM32F4 discovery blinky project
--------------------------------

The example runs on Discovery kit with STM32F407VG MCU and demonstrates
simple project that uses onboard LEDs.

Refer to `the dedicated repository`_ to check how to build and run the example.

Simple host hello world example
-------------------------------

:Location:          ``examples/host_hello``
:Target:            host
:External HW:       none
:Toolchain:         gcc/g++ v5.2 or newer
:Additional SW:     none

This example shows theCore running on the host target.
By `host` target is understood an environment capable to both compile and
run theCore applications.

Application demonstrates a console stream usage and a simple assertion.

STM32F4 discovery and external interrupts from user button

EXTI - the external interrupt.

  An external interrupt is a computer system interrupt that happens as a result
  of outside interference, whether thatâ€™s from the user, from peripherals,
  from other hardware devices or through a network. These are different
  than internal interrupts that happen automatically as the machine
  reads through program instructions.

  -- Techopedia_

In this application, one particular type of external interrupt is used:
GPIO line interrupt. When voltage level changes on the line (e.g. when button is
pressed), interrupt is generated.
