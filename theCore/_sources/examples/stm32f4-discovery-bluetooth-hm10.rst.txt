STM32F4 discovery and HM-10 Bluetooth LE (4.0) wireless module
--------------------------------------------------------------

:Location:          ``examples/hm10``
:Target:            STM32F4 Discovery board
:External HW:       UART-to-USB converter attached to the USART2, HM-10 module, Android device
:Toolchain:         GNU arm-none-eabi v.5.2 or newer
:Additional SW:     openocd, minicom, `BLE Terminal`_ Android app


This example demonstrates using of :ref:`theCore_HM-10` using theCore.
With Bluetooth application on Android device it is possible to establish
communication link between the smartphone and any embedded device with
HM-10 attached.

It this particular example, STM32F4 Discovery board is used.

#. Connect USART2 and power to HM-10_  on the Discovery board using following pins:

   +-------------------+-----------------+
   | PA2 (USART2 TX)   | module's RX     |
   +-------------------+-----------------+
   | PA3 (USART2 RX)   | module's TX     |
   +-------------------+-----------------+
   | +3.3V             | module's VDD    |
   +-------------------+-----------------+
   | GND               | module's GND    |
   +-------------------+-----------------+

#. Attach any preferable UART-to-USB converter `such as this`_ module according to following pinout:

   +-------------------+-----------------+
   | PD8 (USART3 TX)   | module's RX     |
   +-------------------+-----------------+
   | PD9 (USART3 RX)   | module's TX     |
   +-------------------+-----------------+
   | GND               | module's GND    |
   +-------------------+-----------------+

Installing additional software on Android smartphone
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  :alt: BLE Terminal download app

To be able to communicate with HM-10 module via Android smartphone, a special
application must be installed.

Open Play Store and find `BLE Terminal`_ app. Install it as usual.

Building
~~~~~~~~

#. Complete :ref:`theCore_examples_initial_setup` section.
#. Execute build commands.
   The CMake Toolchain file is required to build this application.
   theCore already has one suitable for this target.

   ::

     cd examples/hm10
     mkdir build
     cd build
     cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../../../toolchains/arm-cm4-gnu.cmake ..
     make

Running
~~~~~~~

Firmware will be flashed via ``openocd`` and ``gdb``.

#. Connect stm32f4 Discovery board to USB cable and connect USB <-> UART converter to the PC.
#. Launch ``openocd`` using script from openocd installation.

   ::

     # From new terminal
     openocd -f board/stm32f4discovery.cfg

#. Launch ``minicom`` with device associated with USB <-> UART converter.
   (``/dev/ttyUSB0`` here used as an example)::

     # From new terminal
     minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0

#. Provided that your main terminal's current directory is ``build``,
   launch ``gdb``::

     # From the build directory
     arm-none-eabi-gdb hm10_example

#. Under GDB shell, connect to ``openocd`` and flash firmware::

     (gdb) target remote :3333
     Remote debugging using :3333
     0x00000000 in ?? ()

     (gdb) monitor reset halt
     target state: halted
     target halted due to debug-request, current mode: Thread
     xPSR: 0x01000000 pc: 0x08000188 msp: 0x20020000

     (gdb) load
     Loading section .text, size 0x7678 lma 0x8000000
     Loading section .data, size 0x3c lma 0x8007678
     Start address 0x800477c, load size 30388
     Transfer rate: 18 KB/sec, 10129 bytes/write.

#. Start new firmware::

     (gdb) continue
     Continuing.

#. Check ``minicom`` terminal. You should be able to see::

    :alt: BLE Terminal app main window

#. Select HM-10 device.

#. You will be presented with a terminal window where the data sent from device is displayed

#. Now, type something to the terminal prompt in BLE Terminal app and tap "Send ASCII" button:
