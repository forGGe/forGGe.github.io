STM32F4 discovery and external interrupts from user button
----------------------------------------------------------

:Location:          ``examples/stm32f4_exti``
:Target:            STM32F4 Discovery board
:External HW:       UART-to-USB converter attached to the USART3
:Toolchain:         GNU arm-none-eabi v.5.2 or newer
:Additional SW:     openocd, minicom

EXTI - the external interrupt.

  An external interrupt is a computer system interrupt that happens as a result
  of outside interference, whether thatâ€™s from the user, from peripherals,
  from other hardware devices or through a network. These are different
  than internal interrupts that happen automatically as the machine
  reads through program instructions.

  -- Techopedia_

In this application, one particular type of external interrupt is used:
GPIO line interrupt. When voltage level changes on the line (e.g. when button is
pressed), interrupt is generated.

Wiring

   :alt: UART wiring for stm32f4discovery EXTI example

#. Attach any preferable UART-to-USB converter `such as this`_ module according to following pinout:

   +-------------------+-----------------+
   | PD8 (USART3 TX)   | module's RX     |
   +-------------------+-----------------+
   | PD9 (USART3 RX)   | module's TX     |
   +-------------------+-----------------+
   | GND               | module's GND    |
   +-------------------+-----------------+

Below is the example wiring.


Building
~~~~~~~~

#. Complete :ref:`theCore_examples_initial_setup` section.
#. Execute build commands.
   The CMake Toolchain file is required to build this application.
   theCore already has one suitable for this target.

   ::

     cd examples/stm32f4_exti
     mkdir build
     cd build
     cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../../../toolchains/arm-cm4-gnu.cmake ..
     make

Running
~~~~~~~

Firmware will be flashed via ``openocd`` and ``gdb``.

#. Connect stm32f4 Discovery board to USB cable and connect USB <-> UART converter to the PC.

#. Launch ``minicom`` with device associated with USB <-> UART converter.
   (``/dev/ttyUSB0`` here used as an example)::

     # From new terminal
     minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0

#. Determine stm32f4discovery board revision.

   If you don't remember your board revision, check FAQ section
   :ref:`theCore_STM32F4_Discovery_rev`.

#. Launch ``openocd`` and flash image using script from openocd installation.

   For old STM32F407G-DISC boards, with STLINK/V2:

   ::

     sudo $(which openocd) -f board/stm32f4discovery.cfg -c 'init; reset halt; flash write_image erase exti.bin 0x08000000; reset run; exit'

   For new STM32F407G-DISC1 boards, with STLINK/V2.1:

   ::

     sudo $(which openocd) -f board/stm32f429disc1.cfg -c 'init; reset halt; flash write_image erase exti.bin 0x08000000; reset run; exit'

   See :ref:`theCore_SudoOpenOCD_Nix` section to get insight why ``which openocd``
   is important.

   .. note::

     Optionally, complete the :ref:`theCore_OpenOCD_NoRoot` guide, to be able
     run OpenOCD without superuser permissions.

#. Press blue user button on the Discovery board and observe output in ``minicom``.

Expected output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In ``minicom`` you should be able to see:

- Before button press::

    Welcome to theCore
    Hello, Embedded World!

- After each button press::

    Button pressed!
