No special wiring is required. Just connect the board to the powered USB port.

Building
~~~~~~~~

#. Complete :ref:`theCore_examples_initial_setup` section.
#. Execute build commands.
   The CMake Toolchain file is required to build this application.
   theCore already has one suitable for this target.

   ::

       mkdir build
       cd build
       cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../../toolchains/arm-cm4-gnu.cmake ..
       make

Running
~~~~~~~

#. Flash firmware via UniFlash_. The UniFlash interface is straightforward.

#. Launch ``minicom`` with device associated with the board.
   (``/dev/ttyACM0`` here used as an example)::

     # From new terminal
     minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0

Expected output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In ``minicom`` you should be able to see::

  Welcome to theCore
  Starting TM4C led demo...
