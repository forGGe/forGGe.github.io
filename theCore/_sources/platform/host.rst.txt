Host
----

Host platform is not a full-featured platform, like :ref:`theCore_STM32`,
but rather a place for evaluation and running unit tests.

``console`` option in the "Host" menu controls whether console is enabled
in the platform, or not.

For more details on theCore console, check the :ref:`theCore_Console` section.
