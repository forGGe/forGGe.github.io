STM32
-----

The STM32 is a family of 32-bit Flash microcontrollers based on the
ARM Cortex-M processor. theCore supports two families of STM32: STM32F4 and STM32L1

.. important:: The platform is configured by theCore configurator.
    To make sure you are familiar with it, check the :ref:`theCore_Configurator`
    section before going any further.

Minimal configuration JSON file for the STM32 MCU must contain the platform
object with following fields:

  * ``name`` - platform name (simply ``stm32``)
  * ``device`` - desired device ID. Depends on MCU.
  * ``clock`` - the clock configuration:

    * ``source`` - the clock source. Depends on board capabilities and MCU.
    * ``speed`` - the clock speed in Hz.

.. important:: Currently, only ``HSE`` clock source is supported.

For example, STM32F4 Discovery board the basic configuration can look like that:

.. code-block:: json
   :linenos:

   {
        "platform": {
            "name": "stm32",
            "device": "STM32F407VG",
            "clock": {
                "source": "HSE",
                "speed": 8000000
            }
        }
    }

To import all generated definitions into the application code, simply add following
line to your source:

.. code-block:: cpp

    #include <aux/generated.hpp>

For more JSON configuration examples for STM32 platform, refer to
the :ref:`theCore_Examples` page.

Following sections provide in-depth description of peripheral configuration.
Arm yourself with the Reference Manual from ST before going any further.

.. _STM32 RM:

.. hint:: Hereinafter **RM** stands for *Reference Manual* from MCU vendor.
    Note that some STM32 families has more than one RM per family.
    Pick appropriate, based on your concrete MCU model.
    Below are links to RMs for each supported family.

Periphery overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

STM32 MCU peripheries, can be configured within the same JSON file.
Layout of the platform configuration object is described by JSON schema,
placed under ``platform/stm32/schemas/stm32.schema.json``:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../../platform/stm32/schemas/stm32.schema.json
    :language: json
    :linenos:

Each periphery configuration placed under a property with a relevant name.
The example below illustrates UART periphery being added to JSON config:

.. code-block:: json
   :emphasize-lines: 9-15
   :linenos:

    {
        "platform": {
            "name": "stm32",
            "device": "STM32F407VG",
            "clock": {
                "source": "HSE",
                "speed": 8000000
            },
            "uart": [
                {
                    "id": "USART3",
                    "baud": 115200,
                    "alias": "test_uart"
                }
            ]
        }
    }

Note that to use any of periphery, corresponding pins must be configured too.
**Do not forget to include pin multiplexing configuration for each desired periphery.**

:Driver source:     ``platform/stm32/export/aux/usart_bus.hpp``
:Template file:     ``platform/stm32/templates/uart_cfg.in.hpp``

The instance of the driver, generated during the configuration step, can
be used directly by its API or indirectly, as underlying device for theCore
console.

Check :ref:`the console configuration section<STM32 Console>` to get
information about selecting particular UART as a console output.

STM32 theCore UART supports only IRQ mode, where interrupt is generated after
each byte transmission. DMA mode is not yet implemented.

DMA overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~

:Driver sources:    ``platform/stm32/family/export/stm32_dma_wrap_interface.hpp``
                    ``platform/stm32/family/f4xx/export/stm32_dma_wrap.hpp``
:Template file:     ``platform/stm32/family/f4xx/templates/dma_cfg.in.hpp``

Direct memory access (DMA) is used in order to provide high-speed data transfer between
peripherals and memory and between memory and memory. Data can be quickly moved by
DMA without any CPU action. This keeps CPU resources free for other operations.

.. warning:: DMA configuration via JSON is supported only for STM32F4 family.

In most cases, DMA is used internally by the platform-level drivers.
Platform drivers, like I2C or I2S can be linked with particular DMA by using
its alias.

Each driver with DMA support will include corresponding DMA example.

Configuration parameters (stream, channel, etc.) heavily depends on MCU model.
Refer to the :ref:`RM <STM32 RM>` for allowed DMA configuration for selected periphery.
